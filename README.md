1. How long did you spend to complete the test?

It took me 1hr 15min to complete the task as some files where missing from the folder which i didn't until a little bit later so had to install them so as to run the codes.

2. What was easy?

The easiest was creating the migration, seeder & controller.

3. What was hard?

I wouldn't say i found anything difficult creating the test but getting the route took more time.
